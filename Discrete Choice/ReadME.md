This program is used to develop discrete choice experiments that study main effects using smaller "fractional factorial designs"
The program: A) identifies the smallest design that balances main effects
             B) finds all paired comparisons for the design in A
             C) pulls in true random numbers from random.org to permute the choices in B
             D) identifies the number of questions per subject needed to complete different runs through the n questions
